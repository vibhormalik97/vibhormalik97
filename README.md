### Hi there 👋

I'm a mechanical engineer turned data scientist who is passionate about artificial intelligence and its ability to make our world a better place. Typically, I like to work on projects involving business analytics, nlp, reinforcement learning, or finance. In my spare time, you will either find me cooking or travelling.


- 🔭 I’m currently working on BERT-based sentence similarity models at Rupert LLC in New York as a Data Science Intern
- 🌱 I’m currently learning reinforcement learning with a specific interest in its applications in NLP and finance.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me at any of the links shared above :)
