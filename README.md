### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a mechanical engineer turned data scientist who is passionate about artificial intelligence and its ability to make our world a better place. Typically, I like to work on projects involving business analytics, nlp, reinforcement learning, or finance. In my spare time, you will either find me cooking or travelling.
